# Jen Hong's Udacity Feedreader-Testing-Project
## Purpose 
This project was meant to test and improve my ability to set up a more optimal development environment by writing test codes in Jasmine to minimize risks of errors/disasters. 

## What Was Done
I utilized the started code provided by Udacity - index.html, app.js, and all css files. 
'feedreader.js' in 'jasmine' -> 'spec' folder is the only file that was edited. 

## How to View/Run the Submitted Test Codes in 'feedreader.js'
Gulp was enabled for this project with customized tasks related to running SpecRunner on Jasmine. SpecRunner.html file was also created separately to allow testing in a safe environment. 

**You may have to install gulp (v.4.0.0), gulp-watch, jasminecore, jasminebrowser, and puppeteer in order to run the feedreader.js file seamlessly**

**The feedreader.js script has been disabled in index.html so go to SpecRunner.html to see the results of the test codes from feedreader.js**

Note: the SpecRunner.html ran into an error with a script src "https://www.google.com/jsapi". This causes the Jasmine test results to indicate ScriptError. Disregard this message.
